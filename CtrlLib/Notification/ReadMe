Notification package for U++
-----------------------------
This class implements a passive notifications manager. 
Notifications are simple message boxes that are similar to prompts in that they can allow the 
same basic user actions. However, notifications are not meant as a replacement for the traditional
U++ dialogs. The main difference between the notifications and the prompts is that the notifications
are implemented as frames instead of dialogs, and are meant to be less intrusive and non-blocking.

There are several types of notifications:

- Information: Should be used to displaying common information.
- Warning:     Should be used to report not critical issue, but not everything is all right.
- Success:     Should be used to display successful operations. Essentially this is an information notification.
- Question:    Should be used to ask for some interaction.
- Error:       Should be used to display critical application errors
- Custom:      If the predefined notification types don't suit your needs, you can create one.

Notifications use QTF texts. This allows for embedding hyperlinks in notifications. 
It also means that in some cases the text messages should be de-qtf'd, using DeQtf() function.
